Policies

    * no jerks
    * no video calls (to clarify: not EARLY on, but fine once we're no longer strangers)
    * no commutes (tho travel for work/biz reasons, when needed, is fine)
    * prefer people who use my time efficiently
    * prefer people who let me work for/with them in a way that maximizes what I can deliver
    * prefer people who demonstrate how much they value me (not necessarily in $!)
    * ... and I strive to do the same thing, in return
    * will not talk/deal with third-party recuiters or outside headhunters

Side Projects

    * Slartboz: making a new real-time Rogue-like game (with a retro Terminal-based TUI) in a futuristic, sci-fi, post-apoc setting. style/theme for fans of Wasteland/Fallout, Idiocracy, HHGG (Douglas Adams), Stranger Things, X-COM and Dwarf Fortress. The engine is homegrown. I've been making game engines (both as a hobby in my free time, and, sometimes for clients) for decades.

              https://github.com/mkramlich/latlearn

    * writing a book about software performance and scalability
