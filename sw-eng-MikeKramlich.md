Policies

* prefer people who use my time *efficiently*
* prefer people who let me work for/with them in a way that *maximizes* what I can deliver
* prefer people who *demonstrate* how much they value me (not necessarily in $!)
* ... and I strive to do the same thing, in return
* will not talk/deal with *third-party* recruiters or *outside* headhunters
* no *commutes* (tho *travel* for work/biz reasons, when needed, is fine)
* no *video* calls (to clarify: not EARLY on, but fine once we're no longer strangers)
* no *jerks*

Side Projects

* **Slartboz:** making a new real-time Rogue-like game (with a retro Terminal-based TUI) in a futuristic, sci-fi, post-apoc setting. style/theme for fans of Wasteland/Fallout, Idiocracy, HHGG (Douglas Adams), Stranger Things, X-COM and Dwarf Fortress. The engine is homegrown. And btw: I've been making game engines (both as an unpaid hobby in my free time, and, sometimes for clients or for the indie game market) for decades. My first public Rogue-like game (Dead By Zombie, in 2007) appeared to be the world's 1st commerical Rogue-like and the 1st one known to be written in Python.
